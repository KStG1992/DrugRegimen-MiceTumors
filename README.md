# Matplotlib-Challenge

## Background

The dataset and results come from a study of 249 mice identified with SCC tumor growth. These mice were treated through a variety of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticals' drug of interest, Capomulin, versus the other treatment regimens.
